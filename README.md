## Project Notes

> [!NOTE]
> **This is a basic vanilla JavaScript proof of concept** built for a simple need. [Read the blog post about how and why I built it](https://andreklein.net/i-built-my-own-damn-crossposter-because-2025-social-media-is-a-fragmented-hellscape/). It may benefit from refactoring to React/TypeScript in the future.

> [!TIP]
> **Minimalist by design** - I have no plans to turn this into a super-app with endless features. For more advanced social media management tools, check out [Postiz](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Current implementation details:**
> - Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons are loaded via CDN for simplicity
> - Tested on Linux (Arch CachyOS) and Windows 11
> - Mac builds need testing

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run as Electron App (Recommended)

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

For development (with hot-reload):
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Vite dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Launch Electron app
npm start
```

### Option 2: Build Distributable Packages

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates platform-specific packages in the `dist/` folder:
- **Linux**: `.AppImage` file
- **macOS**: `.dmg` file  
- **Windows**: `.exe` installer

## Setup

### Get Your API Credentials

#### Mastodon

1. Log in to your Mastodon instance (e.g., mastodon.social)
2. Go to Settings → Development → New Application
3. Give it a name (e.g., "SocialSox")
4. Select permissions: `read:notifications`, `write:media`, `write:statuses`
5. Click "Submit"
6. Copy your **instance URL** (just the domain like `https://mastodon.social`, NOT your profile URL)
7. Copy your **access token** from the application page

#### Bluesky

1. Log in to Bluesky
2. Go to Settings → App Passwords
3. Create a new app password
4. Use your handle (e.g., `username.bsky.social`) and the app password

#### Twitter

1. Go to [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
2. Create a project and app (or use existing)
3. **IMPORTANT: Configure OAuth 1.0a permissions:**
   - Click on your app → **Settings** tab
   - Scroll to "User authentication settings"
   - Click **"Set up"** or **"Edit"**
   - Enable **OAuth 1.0a** by choosing "Web App, Automated App or Bot"
   - Set **App permissions** to **"Read and Write"** (not just "Read")
   - For **Callback URL**: Enter your GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/socialsox`) or any valid URL - it's not actually used but required by Twitter
   - For **Website URL**: Enter the same GitHub repository URL or any valid URL like `https://github.com/yourusername/socialsox`
   - Click **Save**
   
   > **Note**: We're using OAuth 1.0a with your own Access Tokens (not the 3-legged OAuth flow), so the callback URL won't actually be used. Twitter just requires these fields to be filled in.
4. Go to **"Keys and Tokens"** tab
5. **Regenerate** your Access Token and Access Token Secret (important after changing permissions!)
6. Copy all 4 credentials:
   - **API Key** (also called Consumer Key)
   - **API Secret** (also called Consumer Secret)
   - **Access Token** (newly regenerated)
   - **Access Token Secret** (newly regenerated)

### Enter Credentials & Post

Use the **Settings** tab to configure your API credentials. They're encrypted locally using Electron's safeStorage for security.

**Portability**: Use the "📤 Export Credentials" button to save your credentials to a JSON file for backup or transfer to another device. Use "📥 Import Credentials" to load them back.

Switch to the **Post** tab to:
- Select platforms to post to
- Type your message (with character counter)
- Upload an image (drag & drop or click)
- Click "Post to Selected Platforms"!

Check the **History** tab to view your past posts and their status.

## Security Notes

> [!NOTE]
> **Security Features:**
> - ✅ Everything runs locally on your computer
> - ✅ Credentials are encrypted using Electron's safeStorage (OS-level encryption)
> - ✅ Settings stored securely in localStorage
> - ✅ Twitter OAuth handled securely in Electron backend
> - ✅ No external servers involved (except the social media APIs)

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Considerations:**
> - ⚠️ SafeStorage encryption requires your OS to have a password/login set up
> - ⚠️ If safeStorage is unavailable, credentials fall back to encrypted localStorage
> - ⚠️ Use app-specific passwords where available (like Bluesky's app passwords)

For security-related concerns, please see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).

## Limitations

> [!CAUTION]
> **Current Limitations:**
> - No multiple image support (single image only)
> - No thread/reply support
> - Character limits: Twitter 280 chars, Mastodon 500+ (varies by instance), Bluesky 300 chars
> - Image size limit: 5MB
> - Image format support: PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP

## Troubleshooting

**App won't start or icons don't load**: Try running with debug console: `DEBUG=1 ./SocialSox.exe` (Windows) or `DEBUG=1 ./SocialSox` (Linux/Mac) to see error messages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Twitter Errors**:
> - **"oauth1 app permissions" error**: Your app isn't configured correctly
>   1. Go to your app's **Settings** → "User authentication settings"
>   2. Enable **OAuth 1.0a** with **"Read and Write"** permissions
>   3. Go to **"Keys and Tokens"** tab
>   4. **Regenerate** your Access Token and Access Token Secret (critical!)
>   5. Use the new tokens in SocialSox
> - Make sure you have all 4 credentials entered correctly
> - Old tokens won't work after changing permissions - you must regenerate them

> [!TIP]
> **Common Configuration Issues**:
> - **Instance URL Errors**: Use only the domain (e.g., `https://mastodon.social`), not your profile URL
> - **Mastodon Errors**: Make sure your instance URL is correct and includes `https://`
> - **Bluesky Errors**: Use your full handle including the domain (e.g., `user.bsky.social`)
> - **Image Upload Issues**: Ensure your image is under 5MB and in a supported format (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP)

## Development

### Prerequisites
